# JATE - Just Another Text Editor

## Overview

JATE, "Just Another Text Editor", is a progressive web application (PWA) that allows users to write and save text notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection. Leveraging modern web technologies, JATE provides an intuitive and reliable platform for storing ideas and information on the go.
